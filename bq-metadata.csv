Data was generated using the 10X Genomics and was processed using SEQC, where reads were mapped to HG38, followed by cell filtering for mitochondrial fraction > 20%, empty droplet filtering (scCB2), and doublet removal (doubletdetection). Genes that were expressed in more than 10 cells were retained.
